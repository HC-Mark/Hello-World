# Hello-World
My first GitHub repositor
My name is Tianming Xu, a haverford computer science major sophomore. 
I mean, even though I am a computer science major, i know very little about computer
My favorite interest is playing game, that is one of the reason I choose to learn computer scinece in college.
I know this sounds nonsense.
But since it is an experiment for tutorial, I have to say
Over.
